# Investment Calculator

## [Visit Live Site](https://ramsey-investment-calculator.vercel.app/)

This is a clone of an investment calculator I use often ([Ramsey Solution Investment Calculator](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/retirement/investment-calculator)). 

## Why
- app has many state changes
- Some numbers are not accurate.

## Project Focus

- responsive interface
- turn a psd into a website
- manage state using React's context api
- validate user input
- consume charting api ([QuickChart.io](https://quickchart.io/)) asynchronously based off user input.

## This was build using

- Next.js (React.js framework)
- Tailwind.css (css)
