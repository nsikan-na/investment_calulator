This is an clone of an investment calculator I use often ([Ramsey Solution Investment Calculator](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/retirement/investment-calculator)).


## Project Focus
* responsive interface
* turn a psd into a website
* manage state using React's context api
* validate user input
* consume charting api ([QuickChart.io](https://quickchart.io/)) asynchronously based off validated user input. 

## This was build using

- React.js (html,javascript)
- Tailwind.css (css)
