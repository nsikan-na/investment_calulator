# Investment Calculator

[Visit Live Site](https://nsikan-investment-calculator.netlify.app/)

This is an clone of an investment calculator I use often (Ramsey Solution Investment Calculator). My focus of this project was to provide a responsive interface, turn a psd into a website, manage state using React's context api,and connect to an charting api asynchronously based off validated user input.

## This was build using

- React.js (html,javascript)
- Tailwind.css (css)
- Material UI
