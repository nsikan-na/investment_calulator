# Rasmey Investment Calculator Clone

## [Visit Live Site](https://ramsey-investment-calculator.vercel.app/)

The application is used to calculate the amount of money the user would have based off of validated input they enter. It uses the QuickChart.io for charting data. This is a clone of an investment calculator I use often ([Ramsey Solution Investment Calculator](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/retirement/investment-calculator)). The Ramsey Solution Investment Calculator has many state changes which is perfect for react and some numbers are not accurate.

## This was build using

- Next.js (React.js framework)
- Typescript
- Tailwind.css (css)
- QuickChart.io Api
